# Basic-Portfolio

##Getting Started
A deployed version of the site can be found here https://drogalsky.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/

## Usage
Click the navbar to go between pages. The about page is just a small snippet about me the three buttons at the bottom will bring you to my github and linkedin the resume currenlty does nothing as I'm updating it. The contacts page is where you would send an email to me but currently the button does nothing. The portfolio page currently has one gorup project I worked on and two other assignments. You can click the pictures to go to the deployed site or the link to go to the repository.

## Challenges
Setting the form up took a lot of time for the text boxes I set the width to 900px (60 less than the container of 960px) and gave them 30px side margin for the textarea I changed it to 900px then changed the height until it came to just above the button. This allowed for a more uniform look with the evenly spaced headers and I'm happy with the final product. In the future I would change the forms ability to react to the space of the screen.

I like making navbars but I actually had a bit of trouble with this one caused by the default margins and such. The reset css file saved me a lot of headache by taking out all default styling. The allignment on my name is accomplished with a height of 100% and a very large left margin.

This was my first real project on git. So i had a few issues getting some of my changes to work on the deployed git page. Getting into a habit of commiting often was also hard but by the end I was remembering to commit after every section of a page was done.

UPDATED: I basically unlinked my old css file and started a new one so that I could build with mobile in mind from the start. But the biggest issue I had was probably getting the project divs to fit in the wrapper div without the wrapper div shrinking entirely. It took me a bit to realize that this is the exact issue inline-block was made for.

Im not sure what I think about the color scheme. Might change it later.
