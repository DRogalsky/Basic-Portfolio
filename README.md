Click the navbar to go between pages. The about page is just a small snippet about me. The contacts page is where you would send an email to me but currently the button does nothing. The portfolio page is just a place holder for now but the pictures will soon be links to my

## Challenges
Setting the form up took a lot of time for the text boxes I set the width to 900px (60 less than the container of 960px) and gave them 30px side margin for the textarea I changed it to 900px then changed the height until it came to just above the button. This allowed for a more uniform look with the evenly spaced headers and I'm happy with the final product. In the future I would change the forms ability to react to the space of the screen.

I like making navbars but I actually had a bit of trouble with this one caused by the default margins and such. The reset css file saved me a lot of headache by taking out all default styling. The allignment on my name is accomplished with a height of 100% and a very large left margin.

This was my first real project on git. So i had a few issues getting some of my changes to work on the deployed git page. Getting into a habit of commiting often was also hard but by the end I was remembering to commit after every section of a page was done.
